# Rise_of_Hexapod

This reposority for my Hexapod project.

I am Emin Akman, a mechatronics engineer with a strong focus on embedded systems development. This project is designed for the ESP32 WROOM 32D and uses 18 MG995 servos for movement control. To efficiently manage all 18 servos, I implemented 2 PCA9685 PWM driver.

This project is both an opportunity for personal development and forms part of my graduation work. I will be regularly updating the repository as the project progresses, and I invite you to check back for the latest developments.
